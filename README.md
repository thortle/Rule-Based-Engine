# Rule-Based Text Chunker

## 1. Project Goal

To develop and evaluate a simple, rule-based Python chunker capable of segmenting French and English text into basic syntactic units (e.g., SN, SP, SV). The core principle is to keep the chunking engine logic (`chunker.py`) generic, while encoding language-specific knowledge (vocabulary, syntax patterns) primarily within external data files (`lang_fr/lexicon.json`, `lang_fr/rules.json`) for maintainability and adaptability. The project demonstrates an iterative approach to rule development and adaptation across texts with varying topics and sources.

## 2. Final Project Structure

-   **`chunker.py`**: The main Python script containing the rule-based chunking engine (tokenization, rule matching, output generation).
-   **`lang_fr/`**: Directory containing the knowledge base for French.
    -   **`lexicon.json`**: Lists of French words mapped to custom lexical categories (Det, N, N_Prop, P, V, Vinf, Vpart, Adj, Adv, CS, CC, Aux, Mod_V, ProS, PPS, Pro_Compl, Pro_Obj, Neg, Pref, Quote_O, Quote_C, Interj, Num). Derived iteratively from `gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv` and subsequent text analyses.
    -   **`rules.json`**: List of French chunking rules. Each rule maps a pattern (primarily `lookup` or `sequence` of `lookup`s, plus some `suffix` and `regex`) to a custom syntactic category (SN, SP, SV, etc.). Derived iteratively.
-   **`lang_en/`**: Directory for English linguistic resources.
    -   `lexicon.json`: English lexicon (words mapped to categories).
    -   `rules.json`: English chunking rules (primarily lookup/sequence based).
-   **`data/`**: Input texts and analysis data.
    -   `gorafi_sports.txt`: Original Gorafi text (Sports).
    -   `gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv`: "Gold standard" manual-style chunking of `gorafi_sports.txt`, with precisely defined `Marqueurs` (used as the basis for the initial French ruleset).
    -   `gorafi_medical.txt`: Second Gorafi text (Medical). Used for testing generalization and refining French rules.
    -   `figaro_text.txt`: Figaro text (Sports). For later testing of French rules on a different source.
    -   `english_sports.txt`: English text (Sports). For later testing of language adaptability.
    -   `output/`: Contains chunked output files (`*_chunked_auto.html`, `*_chunked_auto.txt`).
-   **`style.css`**: CSS for styling HTML output (embedded in `chunker.py`).
-   **`README.md`**: This documentation.
-   **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies (uses only standard libraries).

## 3. Chunker Engine Logic (`chunker.py`)

The engine operates based on a defined lexicon and a list of rules:

1.  **Language & Text Selection:** The user selects the target language and input text file.
2.  **Rule/Lexicon Loading:** The appropriate `lexicon.json` and `rules.json` are loaded from the selected language subdirectory (`lang_fr/` or `lang_en/`).
3.  **Tokenization:** The input text is split into a list of string tokens using a regex (`r"\w+(?:[-']\w+)*|[^\w\s]"`) that handles words, punctuation, apostrophes, and simple hyphenation. Original surface forms are preserved.
4.  **Rule Application (`chunk_text` function):**
    *   The engine iterates through the tokens.
    *   At each position, it first attempts to match **sequence rules** from `rules.json`. The engine prioritizes the *first* sequence rule in the list that matches the current token sequence. (Implicitly, longer sequences should be defined before shorter ones if they start with the same tokens).
    *   If no sequence rule matches, it attempts to match **single-token rules** (lookup, suffix, regex). Again, the *first* matching single-token rule in the list is applied.
    *   The `matches_element` helper function supports pattern types:
        *   `lookup`: Exact, case-insensitive word match.
        *   `lexicon_category`: Checks if a token (case-insensitive) belongs to a list in the lexicon associated with the given key.
        *   `suffix`: Checks if a token ends with a specific suffix (case-insensitive).
        *   `regex`: Matches the token against a regular expression.
        *   `category`: A generic fallback check (e.g., not punctuation or a known function word).
5.  **Chunk Creation:** When a rule matches, a chunk is created containing the original text of the consumed token(s) and the category specified by that rule.
6.  **Output:** Statistics are calculated, and the chunked text is generated in both plain text and color-coded HTML formats (with embedded CSS).

## 4. French Rule Development Workflow (`gorafi_sports.txt` & `gorafi_medical.txt`)

The French ruleset was developed iteratively to achieve 100% categorization and coherent chunking on two "Le Gorafi" texts with different topics.

### 4.1. Baseline from `gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv`

*   **Foundation:** The initial `lang_fr/lexicon.json` and `lang_fr/rules.json` were derived *exclusively* from `data/gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv`. This CSV represents a detailed manual-style chunking of `gorafi_sports.txt`, where `Marqueurs` (e.g., `Det:La + N_Prop:Ligue`) were defined to be precise and pattern-like.
*   **Rule Type:** Rules generated from this CSV were primarily sequences of `lookup` patterns (e.g., for marker `Det:La + N_Prop:Ligue`, the rule pattern would be `{"type": "sequence", "elements": [{"type": "lookup", "value": "La"}, {"type": "lookup", "value": "Ligue"}]}`) or single `lookup` patterns for single-word chunks.
*   **Lexicon:** The lexicon was populated with the exact words from the `Marqueurs` (e.g., "La" from `Det:La` added to a "Det" list).
*   **Result:** This highly specific, lookup-driven ruleset achieved 100% categorization on `gorafi_sports.txt`, perfectly replicating the gold standard CSV.

### 4.2. Adaptation for `gorafi_medical.txt`

*   **Initial Test:** Running the ruleset from 4.1 on `gorafi_medical.txt` resulted in a low categorization rate (~21.2%), as most words and phrases were specific to the medical text and not present in the sports-derived rules/lexicon.
*   **Iterative Enrichment & Generalization Strategy:**
    1.  **Lexicon Expansion:** The `lang_fr/lexicon.json` was significantly expanded by adding new vocabulary (common function words, nouns, verbs, adjectives, proper nouns) encountered as UNKNOWN in `gorafi_medical.txt`.
    2.  **Rule Addition & Reordering (Key to Success):**
        *   **High-Priority Specific Lookups:** New `lookup` rules (both single-word and multi-word sequences) were added for specific terms and phrases unique to `gorafi_medical.txt` (e.g., "crise d'appendicite aiguÃ«", "docteur Moulin"). These were placed early in `rules.json`.
        *   **Introduction of General Sequence Rules:** To achieve more coherent (larger) chunks and improve generalization across both texts, more general sequence rules using `{"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "..."}` were introduced. Examples:
            *   `{"pattern_description": "Det + Noun", "category": "SN", "pattern": {"type": "sequence", "elements": [{"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "Det"}, {"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "N"}]}}`
            *   `{"pattern_description": "Prep + Det + Noun", "category": "SP", "pattern": {"type": "sequence", "elements": [{"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "P"}, {"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "Det"}, {"type": "lexicon_category", "key": "N"}]}}`
            These general sequence rules were placed *after* the highly specific lookup rules but *before* single-token fallback rules.
        *   **Low-Priority Single-Token Fallbacks:** `lookup` rules for individual function words (e.g., `P:de -> SP`, `Det:le -> Det`) were placed towards the end of the rule list. This ensures they only fire if the token isn't consumed by a more specific sequence.
        *   **Conflict Resolution:** The "seesaw" effect (improving one text while degrading another) was managed by carefully adjusting the order. Specific lookup rules necessary for `gorafi_sports.txt` were moved higher in priority than some of the newly introduced general sequence rules if a conflict arose.
*   **Result:** Through this careful balancing of specific lookups (for accuracy on known phrases) and more general `lexicon_category`-based sequences (for coherent chunking and some generalization), 100% categorization was achieved on *both* `gorafi_sports.txt` and `gorafi_medical.txt`.

### 4.3. Rationale Behind Rule Design for Gorafi Texts

*   **Replicating Gold Standard:** The primary goal for `gorafi_sports.txt` was perfect replication, achieved through highly specific `lookup` rules derived directly from `gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv`.
*   **Adapting to New Vocabulary:** For `gorafi_medical.txt`, the first step was adding its new words to the lexicon and creating specific `lookup` rules for them.
*   **Achieving Coherent Chunks:** The introduction of general sequence rules (e.g., `Det + Noun -> SN`) was vital for grouping individual tokens (that now had lookup rules) into larger, more meaningful syntactic units like NPs and PPs.
*   **The Importance of Rule Order:** The most critical aspect of successfully adapting the rules for both texts was meticulously managing the order of rules in `rules.json`. The hierarchy was generally:
    1.  Very specific multi-word phrase lookups.
    2.  Specific single-word lookups (especially for ambiguous words or those critical for one text).
    3.  General sequence rules (e.g., `Det + Noun`).
    4.  Fallback single-token lookups for function words.
    This ensured that precise patterns were caught before more general rules could apply, thus maintaining accuracy on the first text while improving coverage and coherence on the second.

## Phase 2: Adaptation to gorafi_medical.txt

### Evaluation of State (Post-gorafi_medical Adaptation)

After completing the adaptation process for `gorafi_medical.txt`, the chunker achieved impressive results across both Gorafi texts:

- **Quantitative Metrics:**
  - **gorafi_sports.txt**: 162 chunks, 0 unknown chunks, 100% categorization rate
  - **gorafi_medical.txt**: 273 chunks, 0 unknown chunks, 100% categorization rate

- **Qualitative Improvements:**
  - **Reduced Granularity**: The number of chunks decreased significantly from the initial runs (from ~300 to 273 for medical text, from ~167 to 162 for sports text), indicating more coherent, larger syntactic units.
  - **Improved Linguistic Coherence**: Named entities (e.g., "Jean-NoÃ«l C."), complex noun phrases (e.g., "crise d'appendicite aiguÃ«"), and verb phrases with auxiliaries (e.g., "L'UEFA a annoncÃ©") are now correctly identified as single chunks.
  - **Consistent Handling of Similar Structures**: Prepositional phrases, negation patterns, and gerund constructions are now chunked consistently across both texts.

- **Remaining Observations:**
  - The chunker now handles a wide variety of linguistic phenomena including elided forms, compound prepositions, negation patterns, and multi-word expressions.
  - The rule ordering principle (specific sequences â general sequences â function word lookups â fallbacks â punctuation) proved crucial for balancing specificity and generalization.

### Adaptation Process Description

The adaptation process for `gorafi_medical.txt` involved several iterative steps, each addressing specific challenges:

- **Initial Run with gorafi_sports Baseline:**
  - Running the initial ruleset (derived exclusively from `gorafi_sports_chunked_gold.csv`) on `gorafi_medical.txt` revealed significant limitations.
  - While the chunker achieved a reasonable categorization rate due to fallback rules, it produced **highly granular and linguistically incoherent chunks**. Many multi-word expressions were broken into individual tokens, and the chunking lacked linguistic intuition.
  - This clearly demonstrated the need for adaptation beyond simple vocabulary expansion.

- **Lexicon Expansion:**
  - **New Vocabulary**: Added medical domain terms (e.g., "appendicite", "chirurgie", "patient") to appropriate lexical categories.
  - **Category Checks**: Ensured consistent categorization of words across both texts (e.g., verifying that "est" is consistently categorized as Mod).
  - **Elision Handling**: Improved handling of elided forms like "d'", "l'", "qu'", ensuring they're properly categorized as P, Det, or CS.

- **Shift in Rule Philosophy:**
  - **From Lookups to Sequences**: Moved away from excessive reliance on exact word lookups toward more general sequence patterns.
  - **Pattern-Based Approach**: Developed rules based on linguistic patterns rather than just memorizing specific phrases from the training text.
  - **Balancing Specificity and Generalization**: Created a hierarchy of rules that prioritizes specific patterns while allowing for generalization.

- **Establishment of Rule Ordering Principle:**
  - **Specific Sequences**: Placed exact multi-word expressions at the top (e.g., "Jean-NoÃ«l C.", "d'une main de maÃ®tre").
  - **General Sequences**: Added patterns like Det+NâSN, P+SNâSP, Neg+AdjâSAdj in the middle section.
  - **Function Word Lookups**: Moved individual function word rules (e.g., "de"âP, "le"âDet) lower in priority.
  - **Fallbacks**: Placed category-based fallbacks (e.g., NâSN, VâSV) near the end.
  - **Punctuation Lookups**: Relegated punctuation rules to the very end to prevent them from interfering with multi-word expressions that include punctuation.

- **Iterative Rule Refinement:**
  - **Adding Specific Sequences**: Identified problematic phrases in the output and created specific rules for them (e.g., "crise d'appendicite aiguÃ«", "contact prolongÃ©").
  - **Developing General Patterns**: Created rules for common linguistic structures like negation (e.g., "ProS + Neg + V + Neg"), gerunds (e.g., "en + Vpart"), and compound prepositions (e.g., "prÃ¨s de").
  - **Implementing Combining Rules**: Added rules to merge adjacent chunks into larger, more coherent units (e.g., SN+SPâSN, SV+SAdvâSV).
  - **Debugging Rule Priority Conflicts**: Identified and resolved cases where rules competed for the same tokens, ensuring the most appropriate rule would win.

- **Final Refinements:**
  - **Targeted Fixes**: Made precise adjustments to handle specific problematic cases (e.g., ensuring "Jean-NoÃ«l C." is chunked as a single entity).
  - **Rule Demotion**: Moved overly broad combining rules (e.g., SV+SNâSV) lower in priority to prevent over-chunking.
  - **Punctuation Handling**: Ensured punctuation is only chunked as a last resort, allowing multi-word expressions that include punctuation to be properly recognized.

This adaptation process transformed the chunker from a text-specific tool into a more robust system capable of handling diverse French texts while maintaining linguistic coherence and achieving 100% categorization.
